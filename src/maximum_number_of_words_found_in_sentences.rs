 *
 * A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single spaceÂ with no
 * leading or trailing spaces.
 *
 * You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i]
 * represents a single sentence.
 *
 * Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this
 * is great thanks very much"]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation:
 * - The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
 * - The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
 * - The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in
 * total.
 * Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third
 * sentence, which has 6 words.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: sentences = ["please wait", "continue to fight", "continue to win"]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number
 * of words.
 * In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same
 * number of words.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= sentences.length <= 100
 * 1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100
 * sentences[i] consists only of lowercase English letters and ' ' only.
 * sentences[i] does not have leading or trailing spaces.
 * All the words in sentences[i] are separated by a single space.
